Cereal Data Visualization 

The purpose of this analysis is to look at data from a recent database with descriptive on over 75 cereals from 6 common manufacturers. Specifically I wanted to investigate how the average rating of cereals across each manufacturer varies along with average calorie total of cereals on average for each manufacturer. Additionally my goal was to check a relationship between the rating a cereal got from reviewers and that cereal's fat content.
